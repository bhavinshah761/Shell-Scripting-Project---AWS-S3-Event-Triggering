This shell scripting project involves leveraging AWS S3 event triggering to automate email notifications when new files are pushed or created into an S3 bucket. This powerful tool is widely utilized by top companies such as Netflix, Airbnb, and Expedia to streamline their operations and enhance their services. For example, Airbnb could use this functionality to notify users about new properties available for booking, while Netflix could inform subscribers about newly added videos.

The project utilizes several AWS services, including S3 buckets, Lambda, IAM (Identity and Access Management), and SNS (Simple Notification Service). When a new file is uploaded or created in the S3 bucket, an event trigger is activated, which invokes an AWS Lambda function. This Lambda function is responsible for sending an email notification through the SNS service, notifying relevant parties about the new file. IAM is used to manage permissions and access controls, ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with the S3 bucket and trigger the event. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of AWS S3 event triggering in automating workflows and enhancing communication processes for businesses.
